# # Assignment 3:  Recommendation systems
#
# Here we'll implement a content-based recommendation algorithm.
# It will use the list of genres for a movie as the content.
# The data come from the MovieLens project: http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
# Note that I have not provided many doctests for this one. I strongly
# recommend that you write your own for each function to ensure your
# implementation is correct.

# Please only use these imports.
